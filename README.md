# winter-certification 11.2023
The first certification using HTML and CSS.
It was necessary to make the page layout according to the template: https://www.figma.com/file/qHqVwEC5nxFbSQCdbsFCVk/template35?type=design&node-id=1-2&mode=design
Using only HTML and CSS without adaptive layout, then upload the link to the project to github.

During development, I created a common indentation system and corrected design errors.
